This project simulates an **Online Retail Database** for practicing and demonstrating SQL skills such as database design, data manipulation, and query optimization.  It is ideal for students, analysts, and developers looking to sharpen their SQL knowledge.

## Project Overview

This database models a basic online retail system, including:
